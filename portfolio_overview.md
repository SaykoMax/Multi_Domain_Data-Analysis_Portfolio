Project 3: Weather Data Analysis

Domain: Climate & Environmental Analytics

Summary

This project analyzes daily weather data to identify temperature trends, rainfall distribution, humidity patterns, and extreme weather events.

Key Outcomes

Detected a gradual increase in temperature over time

Found rainfall to be highly uneven, with few days contributing to most precipitation

Identified strong association between humidity and heavy rainfall

Impact
